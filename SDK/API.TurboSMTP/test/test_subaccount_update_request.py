    TurboSMTP Public APIs

    This document describes all public turboSMTP **V2** API and offers endpoints Descriptions, Parameters, Requests, Responses and Samples of usage.  [Click here to view the previous version of turboSMTP Public API Version 1.0](https://www.serversmtp.com/turbo-api-1)   # Security For the most part (and where not otherwise explicit) turboSMTP’s API requires Authorization.   Authorization to access a user’s resource is granted to clients provided they set  authentication headers into their request, valued with the proper values issued by turboSMTP servers.  ## *  Authorization via ConsumerKey/ConsumerSecret  This type of authorization consists of a pair of headers, named consumerKey and consumerSecret that are created and granted to the end user to be used in a permanent way (unless they´re deleted of course). This kind of authentication is intended to provide access to endpoints features without the need of providing the user the account details (email address + password).  *consumerKey:* Consumer Key Granted.  *consumerSecret:* Consumer Secret Granted.  (Use [/consumerKeys/create](#/consumerkey/createConsumerKey) create a consumer key/secret pair).      ## *  Authorization via Authentication Key  The authentication key is user-based and it is issued by turboSMTP servers upon successful user’s email address + password challenge, performed by means of appropriate request.      *Authorization:* Authorization_Key  (Use [/authentication/authorize](#/authentication/AuthenticationLogin) to obtain an API Key)  # Data Interchange Format  For the most part (and where not otherwise explicit) turboSMTP’s API uses JSON as the data format of choice when it comes to request and response bodies.
