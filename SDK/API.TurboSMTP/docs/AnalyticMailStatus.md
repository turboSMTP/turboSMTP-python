# AnalyticMailStatus

Send Mail Status:  NEW: email has been queued for delivery DEFER: email is in the queue for delivery SUCCESS: email has been delivered. OPEN: email has been opened. CLICK: email has been clicked. REPORT: email has been reported as spam. FAIL: email has bounced. SYSFAIL: email was dropped. UNSUB: email is unsubscribed.
